Subjectivism
-> More extreme form of cultural relativism
-> Each person has their own moral beliefs 
   -> Someone's moral judgements are always right
   -> Can not judge them
-> Without proof of universal morals, you can not judge people for their morals
-> Issues
   -> Some things most people believe are wrong (ex: killing people)

Simple Subjectivism
-> "There are no moral facts; Moral claims are just expressions of feelings." 
-> "When a person expresses a moral claim, it's merely an expression of approval or disapproval"
   -> x = good is the same as "I like x"
   -> x = bad is the same as "I dislike x"
-> Issues
   -> Two people who disagree about a moral claim must say the other is correct
      -> No moral truths, each claim is true for the one who believes it
      -> Implications
         -> Infallibility (every moral claim is correct)
            -> Can't be wrong with your feelings (unless you lie)
         -> Can be no moral disagreements
-> Doesn't solve moral disargeements, so dismiss it

Logical Positivism
-> Saw that there were many philosophy claims that you could not judge
-> Look at language people use to make claims
-> Emotivism
   -> there are different structures of sentences
      -> Fact claim - "It is snowing", true or false
         -> Solve with deduction - "All bachelors are unmarried"
         -> Solve with induction - "16M ravens are black, therefore all ravens are black"
            -> must be falsifiable, verifiable
         -> Often make moral claims as fact claims - "It is wrong to eat kids"
            -> Can't be a fact claim because there are no moral facts
            -> Like the sentence "Juiet is the sun"
               -> Does it mean anything? Must try to figure it out.
               -> Missed the point if you think it is a fact claim
               -> Metaphor
            -> Does not seem to be metaphor
            -> Also like the sentence "The visiting team was killed out there"
               -> Figurative / poetic
               -> Using words in ways that do not match definitions
                  -> People will still understand
            -> "Absolute Nothing nothings"
               -> Meaningless to a logical positivist
      -> Imperative Sentences - "Open the door"
         -> Expresses feelings and trying to change the state of the world
            -> Want the door open, trys to get it done
         -> This is what moral claims are
            -> "It is wrong to eat kids", sounds like a fact claim
               -> Really expressing your feelings and trying to change the world
-> Implications
   -> There are now moral disagreements
      -> Disagreement about what should happen
   -> No moral rules
      -> Friend wants to steal something, you tell them to stop
         -> Friend is not doing anything wrong
         -> You are just trying to stop them
   -> Might makes right
      -> Not immoral to do things to change the world to follow your wants
      -> Can be forced to do what you do not believe (Government, boss, dude with a gun, etc)
-> Same as nihilism?
   -> No difference between right and wrong
   -> Nothing matters
   -> If subjectivism is true, nothing really matters
      -> Feelings are only within you, don't matter outside
   -> Psychological problems
      -> Sucide (something matters)
      -> Staying alive (something matters)

Relativism
-> "All moral claims are relative."
   -> Means "All moral claims are relative, except this one".
   -> Must be one moral claim that is not relative
      -> Relativism is FALSE!
                                
Religion
-> Most people think morals and purpose come from god
   -> "Without god, everthing is permitted."
-> god gives concrete morals
   -> applies to everyone, under all times, no exceptions
-> Pascal's Wager
   -> We don't know if god exists or not.
   -> scandal of particularity
      -> can't believe in many different religions
      -> religion not based on proof
      -> you should be worried
-> Can't tell you on its own what is right and what is wrong
-> Great reason to care

Euthyphro
-> dialectic
   -> One has to be true
      -> A or not-A
-> Divine Command Model
   -> "An act is right if god commands it and wrong is if god forbits it."
   -> Assumptions
      -> god exists
      -> there are some acts that are right and some that are wrong (concrete)
      -> some acts are amoral
      -> can know what god says
      -> culture doesn't matter (no relativism, there is absolute right/wrong)
   -> Implications
      -> Possible to be wrong

Natural Law
-> Use nature to determine moral law
-> Comes from Aristotle
-> teleology
   -> Everything has a purpose (natural or artificial)
   -> Aquinas (some Catholic dude)
      -> All living things -> to reach towards god (soul)
      -> how things work inform us on how they should work
         -> Natural purposes tells us god's will
      -> Problems
         -> Interpretation of nature
         -> nature is pretty fucked up for no reason
            -> random and cruel as shit
         -> theodicy
            -> why did god do WWII??? (THAT BASTARD HE KILLED MANY KENNYS)
         -> natrualistic fallacy (is -> ought)
            -> if something is the case does not mean they should be that way

   -> Problems

         -> you can take care of your self-interest and can help others
            -> Not mutally exclusive
      -> We do know others

      -> Limited Altruism
         -> Can not count on other people
