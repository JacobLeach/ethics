Subjectivism
-> More extreme form of cultural relativism
-> Each person has their own moral beliefs 
   -> Someone's moral judgements are always right
   -> Can not judge them
-> Without proof of universal morals, you can not judge people for their morals
-> Issues
   -> Some things most people believe are wrong (ex: killing people)

Simple Subjectivism
-> "There are no moral facts; Moral claims are just expressions of feelings." 
-> "When a person expresses a moral claim, it's merely an expression of approval or disapproval"
   -> x = good is the same as "I like x"
   -> x = bad is the same as "I dislike x"
-> Issues
   -> Two people who disagree about a moral claim must say the other is correct
      -> No moral truths, each claim is true for the one who believes it
      -> Implications
         -> Infallibility (every moral claim is correct)
            -> Can't be wrong with your feelings (unless you lie)
         -> Can be no moral disagreements
-> Doesn't solve moral disargeements, so dismiss it

Logical Positivism
-> Saw that there were many philosophy claims that you could not judge
-> Look at language people use to make claims
-> Emotivism
   -> there are different structures of sentences
      -> Fact claim - "It is snowing", true or false
         -> Solve with deduction - "All bachelors are unmarried"
         -> Solve with induction - "16M ravens are black, therefore all ravens are black"
            -> must be falsifiable, verifiable
         -> Often make moral claims as fact claims - "It is wrong to eat kids"
            -> Can't be a fact claim because there are no moral facts
            -> Like the sentence "Juiet is the sun"
               -> Does it mean anything? Must try to figure it out.
               -> Missed the point if you think it is a fact claim
               -> Metaphor
            -> Does not seem to be metaphor
            -> Also like the sentence "The visiting team was killed out there"
               -> Figurative / poetic
               -> Using words in ways that do not match definitions
                  -> People will still understand
            -> "Absolute Nothing nothings"
               -> Meaningless to a logical positivist
      -> Imperative Sentences - "Open the door"
         -> Expresses feelings and trying to change the state of the world
            -> Want the door open, trys to get it done
         -> This is what moral claims are
            -> "It is wrong to eat kids", sounds like a fact claim
               -> Really expressing your feelings and trying to change the world
-> Implications
   -> There are now moral disagreements
      -> Disagreement about what should happen
   -> No moral rules
      -> Friend wants to steal something, you tell them to stop
         -> Friend is not doing anything wrong
         -> You are just trying to stop them
   -> Might makes right
      -> Not immoral to do things to change the world to follow your wants
      -> Can be forced to do what you do not believe (Government, boss, dude with a gun, etc)
-> Same as nihilism?
   -> No difference between right and wrong
   -> Nothing matters
   -> If subjectivism is true, nothing really matters
      -> Feelings are only within you, don't matter outside
   -> Psychological problems
      -> Sucide (something matters)
      -> Staying alive (something matters)

Relativism
-> "All moral claims are relative."
   -> Means "All moral claims are relative, except this one".
   -> Must be one moral claim that is not relative
      -> Relativism is FALSE!
                                
Religion
-> Most people think morals and purpose come from god
   -> "Without god, everthing is permitted."
-> god gives concrete morals
   -> applies to everyone, under all times, no exceptions
-> Pascal's Wager
   -> We don't know if god exists or not.
   -> scandal of particularity
      -> can't believe in many different religions
      -> religion not based on proof
      -> you should be worried
-> Can't tell you on its own what is right and what is wrong
-> Great reason to care

Euthyphro
-> dialectic
   -> One has to be true
      -> A or not-A
-> Divine Command Model
   -> "An act is right if god commands it and wrong is if god forbits it."
   -> Assumptions
      -> god exists
      -> there are some acts that are right and some that are wrong (concrete)
      -> some acts are amoral
      -> can know what god says
      -> culture doesn't matter (no relativism, there is absolute right/wrong)
   -> Implications
      -> Possible to be wrong

Natural Law
-> Use nature to determine moral law
-> Comes from Aristotle
-> teleology
   -> Everything has a purpose (natural or artificial)
   -> Aquinas (some Catholic dude)
      -> All living things -> to reach towards god (soul)
      -> how things work inform us on how they should work
         -> Natural purposes tells us god's will
      -> Problems
         -> Interpretation of nature
         -> nature is pretty fucked up for no reason
            -> random and cruel as shit
         -> theodicy
            -> why did god do WWII??? (THAT BASTARD HE KILLED MANY KENNYS)
         -> natrualistic fallacy (is -> ought)
            -> if something is the case does not mean they should be that way

Natural Law (cont)
-> 

Psychological Egoism
-> Not a moral theory
   -> One is implied by it
-> "All human actions are motivated by self-interest"
   -> Every time you have every done anything, you did it out of self-interest
   -> Can not do things because they are right, can only do them out of self-interest
   -> AKA: "Altruism is impossible"
   -> Clarifications
      -> Self-interest != selfishness
      -> Self-interest != pursuit of pleasure
      -> can misunderstand self-interest
   -> Theory not disprovable but also not provable
      -> is not falsifiable

Ethical Egoism
-> Ayn Rand
-> "You should only act in ways that forward your long term self-interest."
   -> "You have no obligation to others."
   -> Do not HAVE to do what is in your self-interest but you should
      -> Do not have to buy psychological egoism
-> Ring of Gyges
   -> ethical egoism claims you should abuse the ring
      -> Only reason you wouldn't normally is because you don't want to go to jail
      -> Maybe you can't be happy if you do? (But not under ethical egoism)
-> Ayn Rand
   -> We can only know our needs. Trying to help others causes harm
   -> Helping is an invasion of privacy
   -> Charity degrades you and them
      -> You act like you are above them, but put them above yourself (give up something for them)
   -> Problems
      -> False dilemema
         -> Say something has to be one way or another but there is actually a third option
         -> you can take care of your self-interest and can help others
            -> Not mutally exclusive
      -> We do know others
         -> If they are in a car accident, we can know they need help
      -> Self Contradiction
         -> We are not supposed to care about other people
         -> But gives arguments that are based on us caring about other people
            -> helping is harm, invasion of privacy, degradation, etc
               -> But we shouldn't care. Only care about ourselves
   -> False universalism
      -> I only want me to follow my self-interest
      -> I want others to have the obligation to help me
      -> Different for everyone, not universal at all

Social Contract
-> Freedom and Security
   -> Getting one reduces other (generally)
-> Convensions
   -> Nothing special about the rules
   -> Work because everyone follows them
-> Hobbes
   -> Wrote Leviathon
   -> Divine Right Of Kings
      -> Monarch serves at the will of god
      -> Not following their rules is not following god
   -> Nature of government is to limit freedom
      -> limiting freedom is based on the premise of violence
         -> Only do stuff because of threat of force
   -> Four Basic Conditions of human life (without government)
      -> Equal needs
         -> Raw survival needs (food, clothing, etc)
         -> Need about the same stuff
      -> Equal power
         -> Have about the same power
         -> No one is powerful enough to be outside of the power of everyone else
      -> scarcity
         -> there is always scarcity
         -> there is never abundance of everything
         -> "If you take pizza, there is less for me"
      -> Limited Altruism
         -> Can not count on other people
         -> People do not have to help you so they may not
   -> With four basic conditions, life is crap
      -> Give up some freedom for security
      -> Can't count on others, so you need government to force everyone to help each other
   -> Need a system of law and order
-> J.J. Rousseau
   -> Swiss
   -> Born natural and nice
      -> Society takes away our natural niceness
      -> Social structures of society enter the mind before you are conscious
   -> We are not equal in power
      -> some people have much more power in making laws
      -> laws always benefit those who write them
      -> if you are a slave, are you better off under a government that support slavery?
         -> NO!
         -> As a slave, your interests are removed!
   -> If government is not doing what its supposed to do, REVOLT!
      -> It is a moral requirment to rebel against a system that is not in your self interest
      -> It is in your interest to not follow the rules
   -> This we are already socilized, we need government
      -> Answer is democracy
         -> System of rules that is in everyone's power
